# TodoListV1

>  Built following Angela Yu's tutorial on Udemy

This basic todo app is built using Express/Node and EJS for templating. The main new technology learned here was using MongoDB and Mongoose to create a database that can be used to persist the todos (which are added from the web app).

The web app does basic **CRUD**, _without the **U** actually_. With Mongoose, it was able to connect to a MongoDB remote database, read data from it, create new data into the database and delete data from the database while displaying all these changes on the Express application.


***The backend was deployed with Render and it connects to a remote MongoDB Atlas database.***
